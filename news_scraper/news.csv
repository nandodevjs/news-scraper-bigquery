It is his eighth diplomatic tour of the region in the eight months since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year. The politics of trying to negotiate an end to the war in Gaza and an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners were already complicated.  They are more tangled than ever now that the Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz has resigned from the war cabinet of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with his political ally Gadi Eisenkot. Both men are retired generals who led the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as chiefs of staff. Without Benny Gantz, the Americans have lost their favourite contact in the cabinet. Now he’s back in opposition, Mr Gantz wants new elections - he is the pollsters’ favourite to be the next prime minister - but Mr Netanyahu is safe as long as he can preserve the coalition that gives him 64 votes in the 120-member Israeli parliament.  That depends on keeping the support of the leaders of two ultranationalist factions. They are Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister. That is the point at which Secretary of State Blinken’s mission collides with Israeli politics. President Joe Biden believes that the time has come to end the war in Gaza.  Mr Blinken’s job is to try to make that happen. But Messrs Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have threatened to bring down the Netanyahu government if he agrees to any ceasefire until they are satisfied that Hamas has been eliminated. They are extreme Jewish nationalists, who want the war to continue until no trace of Hamas remains.  They believe that Gaza, like all the territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan, is Jewish land that should be settled by Jews. Palestinians, they argue, could be encouraged to leave Gaza ""voluntarily"". Antony Blinken is in the Middle East to try to stop the latest ceasefire plan from going the way of all the others. Three ceasefire resolutions in the UN Security Council were vetoed by the US, but now Joe Biden is ready for a deal. On 31 May, the president made a speech urging Hamas to accept what he said was a new Israeli proposal to end the war in Gaza.  It was a three-part deal -  which has now been backed by a UN resolution  - starting with a six-week ceasefire, a ""surge"" of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the exchange of some Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.  The deal would progress to the release of all the hostages, a permanent “cessation of hostilities” and ultimately the huge job of rebuilding Gaza. Israelis should no longer fear Hamas, he said, because it was no longer able to repeat 7 October. President Biden and his advisers knew there was trouble ahead. Hamas insists it will only agree to a ceasefire that guarantees an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war.  The destruction and civilian death inflicted by Israel in Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza during the raid to free four hostages last week can only have strengthened that resolve. The Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza say that 274 Palestinians were killed during the raid. The IDF says the number was less than 100. Mr Biden also recognised that some powerful forces in Israel would object.  ""I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal,"" he said in the speech. ""Regardless of whatever pressure comes."" The pressure came quickly, from Messrs Ben Gvir and Smotrich. They are senior government ministers, viscerally opposed to the deal that Joe Biden presented. It made no difference to them that the deal was approved by the war cabinet, as they are not members.  As expected, they threatened to topple the Netanyahu coalition if he agreed to the deal. Neither Hamas nor Israel have publicly committed to the deal that President Biden laid out.  He accepted that the language of parts of it needed to be finalised. The ambiguity in parts of the proposal might in other conflicts, between other belligerents, allow room for diplomatic manoeuvre. But that would require a shared realisation that the time had come to make a deal, that more war would not bring any benefit. There is no sign that the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is at that point. He seems determined to stick the course he has followed since 7 October.  Some reports out of Gaza said that Palestinians in the ruins of Nuseirat camp were swearing at Hamas as well as Israel for disregarding their lives.  The BBC cannot confirm that, as like other international news organisations it is not allowed by Israel and Egypt to enter Gaza, except under rare and highly supervised trips with the Israeli military. It seems clear though, that vast numbers of Palestinian dead have strengthened, not weakened the resilience of Hamas. For them, survival of their group and its leaders equals victory.  They will focus on the fact that the killing of more than 37,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians – according to the health ministry in Gaza – have brought Israel into deep disrepute.  It faces a case alleging genocide at the International Court of Justice, and applications at the International Criminal Court for arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost two members of the war cabinet, Messrs Gantz and Eisenkot, who wanted a pause in the war to allow negotiations to free hostages. He is more exposed, without the political insulation they provided, to the hardliners, Messrs Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. Perhaps Antony Blinken will urge him to call their bluff, to make the deal and satisfy millions of Israelis who want the hostages back before more of them are killed.  Mr Netanyahu might then have no choice other than to risk his government by gambling on an election.  Defeat will bring forward commissions of enquiry that will examine whether he bears responsibility for the political, intelligence and military failures that allowed Hamas to break into Israel eight months ago. Or Benjamin Netanyahu might default to the techniques of procrastination and propaganda that he has perfected over all his years as Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.  If in doubt, play for time, and push arguments harder than ever.  On 24 July, he will return to one of his favourite pulpits, when he addresses a joint session of the US Congress in Washington DC.  Something better, for him, might emerge."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nnr9945vmo,Guilty on all charges. Will Hunter Biden go to prison?,2 days ago,Bernd Debusmann Jr and Brandon Drenon,"Hunter Biden has been found guilty on all charges related to his drug use and gun possession, making him the first child of a sitting president to be a convicted of a crime.  President Joe Biden's son now awaits sentencing - the maximum he could receive is 25 years in prison, though experts say such a term is very unlikely. Here's what we know about the historic case and what happens next.  If Biden is given a prison sentence, legal experts said that it is very unlikely he would face the maximum 25 years for the three gun charges. Even for the charge of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun, which carries a maximum 10 year penalty, few believe that Biden will face the full potential punishment.  South Texas College of Law Houston professor Dru Stevenson said it would be ""bizarre and unprecedented” if Biden was to receive anything close to five years. “That’s for people that [are] really dangerous, like someone who had already been on the FBI’s watchlist,” he said. Prof Stevenson said there was a “50:50 chance” of a prison term, and that he would expect something closer to 20 months. “It’s hard to predict, but I think it’s very possible,” he said. Prof Stevenson said it was also possible that Biden gets probation, rather than prison.  Biden’s apparent recovery from drug abuse may also be cited by his legal team to merit a lighter sentence. However, he noted that the judge overseeing the case had declined to give Biden’s lawyers “any breaks” during the trial. Judge Maryellen Noreika was tough on Biden’s lawyers during evidentiary hearings, the Texas professor said, and she frequently ruled against defence lawyers’ requests. That could indicate that Biden might face a harsher sentence than most would consider typical.  Judge Maryellen Noreika is expected to schedule a sentencing hearing in the next few weeks. Biden will also meet probation officers for a pre-sentencing report to be used by the judge. In the interim, it is unlikely that he will be held in custody.  Even in the event of a prison sentence, it is not expected that Biden would have to surrender to authorities immediately.  Rather, he would probably be given a date to turn himself in. Former US Assistant Attorney Neama Rahmani told the BBC that after sentencing, Biden's team will have 30 days to appeal, something Mr Rahmani said was very likely. ""This is a case made for appeal,"" he said.  He added that sending Biden to prison would be a ""logistical nightmare"" because of the Secret Service protection he gets as the president's son.  Biden faced three federal charges in the case: two counts of making false statements and one of illegal gun possession.  The charges all relate to his purchase of a revolver at a Delaware gun store on 12 October 2018, which he kept for about 11 days. By Biden's own admission, he was deep in the throes of a ""full-blown addiction"" to crack cocaine at the time. The two false statement charges stemmed from allegations that he lied about his drug use on a federally mandated form when he bought the weapon. The third count was related to his possession of a firearm while using drugs. Before the guilty verdict, President Biden said he would not pardon his son.  When asked in an interview with ABC News if he would rule out the option, he said: ""Yes."" After the verdict he appears to be sticking to the same message.  On Tuesday, he said in a statement: ""I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.""  To convict Mr Biden, prosecutors had to convince jurors that he knowingly made false statements on the form in a bid to deceive the store that sold him the pistol.  Prosecutors relied on deeply personal text messages and other communications made while Mr Biden was in the throes of addiction to prove he was a drug user when he took possession of the gun.  In one such message sent to Hallie Biden a day after the gun was purchased, Biden says he was on his way to meet a dealer named Mookie. Ms Biden, who was called to testify by prosecutors, told the court that the text had meant ""he was buying crack cocaine"". Other witnesses called to the stand were Mr Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and ex-girlfriend Zoe Kestan, who both spoke about his addiction.  Prosecutors have also pointed to Biden's own 2021 memoir, in which he detailed his experiences as a drug user who was ""up twenty-four hours a day, smoking every 15 minutes, seven days a week"". ""All my energy revolved around smoking drugs and making arrangements to buy drugs - feeding the beast,"" he wrote in the book.  While Biden has himself been quiet about the trial, his lawyers focused on how much he was aware of his addiction at the end of the purchase, and on the quality of the evidence itself. When questioning Hallie Biden, defence lawyer Abbe Lowell also sought to cast doubt on whether his client was seen using drugs on the day of the purchase or around it.   The third charge, regarding Mr Biden's alleged possession of a firearm while a drug user, is considered unusual, as it can be hard to prove someone is a drug user and has a gun.  ""It's just really rare that they would go after someone and prosecute them for this,"" Prof Stevenson said. ""But this is a high-profile person and there's been members of Congress demanding he be prosecuted."" Among the most prominent pieces of evidence at the trial is the information on Biden's infamous laptop, which has been the focus of intense media speculation and focus from conservative news outlets.  The laptop contained the text messages and pictures sent and received by Biden around the date of the firearm purchase, which prosecutors argue are evidence of his guilt.  Biden's own lawyers have argued that the computer was tampered with before it fell into the hands of investigators.  Erika Jensen, an FBI agent who was called as a witness to testify about the laptop's contents, confirmed its authenticity to jurors.  The special counsel appointed to oversee the probes into Hunter Biden, David Weiss, has said that the tampering argument is a ""conspiracy theory"" with ""no supporting evidence"". The laptop has also been at the centre of unproven theories linking Biden and his father to corruption, which they both deny.  In addition to the gun charges in Delaware, Biden is facing separate federal charges in California over allegations that he evaded a tax assessment, failed to properly file and pay taxes and filed a fraudulent tax return. Several months after the spectacular collapse of a plea deal that would address both sets of charges last year, Biden also  pleaded not guilty  to the tax charges."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy00gykj13zo,Kevin Spacey says he was 'too handsy’ in the past,2 days ago,Ian Aikman,"Actor Kevin Spacey has described himself as ""being too handsy"" in the past, in a new interview. Speaking with Piers Morgan, the 64-year-old admitted to ""pushing the boundaries"" in reference to allegations of inappropriate behaviour that brought his career to a halt in 2017. Last year, the actor was  found not guilty of all charges of sexual assault  against four men between 2001 and 2013 after a trial in London, and in 2022 a US court  dismissed a sexual assault lawsuit  against him. Spacey is currently  involved in a civil trial over an allegation , which he denies, that he sexually assaulted a man in 2008.  Mr Spacey said his home in Baltimore, where he has lived since 2016, is being foreclosed and sold at auction because he cannot afford to pay the ""many millions"" he owes in legal bills.  The interview, broadcast on the Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube channel, featured a direct discussion of how Mr Spacey views his past behaviour.  When asked to clarify what he meant by ""pushing the boundaries"", the double Oscar winner said: ""Being too handsy, touching someone sexually in a way that I didn't know at the time they didn't want."" Pressed on the potential for this being criminal conduct, Mr Spacey said he has ""been gentle with people"" and he would not use the word ""grope"" to describe his actions.   ""You want to be gentle. You want to see if they're going to respond positively,"" he added. Mr Morgan asked him: “Would you say all of that was consensual or was it an attempt at seduction, that if it was repelled, by definition becomes I guess non-consensual, that if you're being handsy, if you're groping people, and they don't want to do it …” To which Mr Spacey replied: “… then they should let you know they don't want to do it so that you can understand it's non-consensual and stop.” Asked if he could understand that a young actor might worry that someone with his influence could damage their career if they rejected his advances, Mr Spacey said: ""Yes"".  The actor said that he is ready to ""take accountability"" for some of his past actions, which he describes as ""bad, bad, bad behaviour"".  But he also said that ""a whole lot of people"" have made false claims against him.   In May, Mr Spacey  denied fresh allegations against him  which aired in the Channel 4 documentary Spacey Unmasked.  Actors Ruari Cannon and Danny De Lillo both alleged inappropriate behaviour by Mr Spacey in the documentary. Mr Cannon alleged that Mr Spacey touched him inappropriately in public at a press night for an Old Vic theatre production in 2013. Mr Spacey said the allegation was ""ridiculous and it never happened"". Mr De Lillo alleged the actor thrust his groin towards his face while he was seated at a production at the same theatre. Mr Spacey said he found the accusation ""completely offensive"". After the documentary was broadcast, a group of Hollywood stars including Sharon Stone, Stephen Fry and Liam Neeson called for Mr Spacey  to be allowed to return to acting .  Speaking to the Telegraph, Ms Stone said: ""I can't wait to see Kevin back at work. He is a genius."" Mr Spacey won the Oscar for best actor for American Beauty in 2000, and for best supporting actor for The Usual Suspects in 1995. He was also the artistic director at the Old Vic Theatre in London between 2004 and 2015. In a statement, the Old Vic said it had conducted an investigation in 2017 into alleged inappropriate conduct by Mr Spacey at the theatre between 2005 and 2013. It said there were ""no findings of fact"" regarding the actor's alleged misconduct, and  no evidence of formal complaints against him.  Mr Spacey was sacked while filming the Netflix series House of Cards after the first allegations against him emerged in 2017.  His scenes from the then-upcoming Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World were erased and reshot with Canadian actor Christopher Plummer replacing him."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vv6p9k1z1o,US lifts weapons ban on Ukraine's Azov brigade,2 days ago,Jaroslav Lukiv,"The US has lifted its long-standing ban on weapons supplies and training to Ukraine's Azov brigade, whose origins were mired in controversy over alleged links to far-right groups. A state department spokesman told the BBC a vetting process ""found no evidence of gross violations of human rights"" by the brigade.  The Azov brigade, now a unit within Ukraine's National Guard, hailed the move, saying Russia's ""lies... received a devastating blow"". Moscow condemned the decision, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the US was ""even prepared to flirt with neo-Nazis"" to suppress Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made false claims about a ""neo-Nazi regime"" in Kyiv to try to justify first the annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula and backing of pro-Moscow fighters in the east in 2014, and then his full-scale invasion launched in 2022. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the state department spokesman told the BBC that Washington applied a vetting process to the National Guard of Ukraine's 12th Special Forces Azov Brigade and ""found no evidence of gross violations of human rights committed"". ""Russian disinformation attempts to conflate Ukraine's National Guard Unit of 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov with a militia formed to defend Ukraine against Russia's invasion in 2014, called the 'Azov Battalion',"" the spokesman added. Under America's ""Leahy Law"", sponsored in 1997 by then-Senator Patrick Leahy, a finding that a foreign military unit has committed gross violations of human rights means it can be cut off from US military assistance. The US government says it considers torture, extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearance and rape as such types of violations when implementing the law. Reacting to the US decision, the Azov brigade said in a statement: ""The lies about Azov, which the Kremlin regime have been spreading in the West for years, received a devastating blow today. ""Receiving Western weapons and training from the US will not only increase the combat capability of Azov, but most importantly, will contribute to the preservation of the lives and health of the personnel of the brigade."" A volunteer militia battalion called Azov was originally set up in May 2014 to fight Russian-backed forces in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Later that year it was briefly incorporated as a separate regiment in Ukraine's interior ministry before being transferred to the National Guard.  Some members of the original battalion were reported to have had links to far-right and ultra-nationalist groups at the time - but a number of them, including the first commander, later left the unit.  The US banned the regiment from receiving US weapons for the alleged links to the far right.  In 2016, a UN report accused the Azov regiment of ""looting of civilian property, leading to displacement"" in eastern Ukraine. The current leadership of the Azov brigade says its members have no ties to far-right organisations or any other extremist groups - a claim that has not been independently verified. Azov fighters are seen by many in Ukraine as national heroes for defending for months the southern city of Mariupol from a brutal Russian assault.  The port on the Sea of Azov was eventually taken by Moscow in May 2022. Many Azov soldiers are still being held by Russia as prisoners of war, amid accusations that the Ukrainians have been subjected to torture in captivity."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj7793exd15o,US hot dog contest can't stomach champ's vegan deal,2 days ago,Max Matza,"Competitive eating star Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut has been told he cannot join America's premiere hot dog contest after striking a deal with a vegan brand.  His removal from next month's Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in New York came after he agreed sponsorship from Impossible Foods, a vegan hot dog maker in competition with the Nathan's brand. ""We are devastated to learn that Joey Chestnut has chosen to represent a rival brand that sells plant-based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,"" Major League Eating (MLE) said on Tuesday. MLE added that Mr Chestnut was welcome to rejoin the competition, but only if he dropped his vegan sponsorship. ""Joey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at the Nathan’s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest,"" the statement said.  ""We hope he returns when he is not representing a rival brand."" Mr Chestnut has won the Nathan's contest, which is televised in the US, 16 times. The rules of the contest, which is attended by some 40,000 people annually, require competitors to eat as many hot dogs (and buns) as they can in the span of 10 minutes.  Mr Chestnut, 40, holds the world record for hot dog eating, having scoffed a whopping 76 at the 2021 contest.  He also holds a variety of other  eating records , including downing 141 hard-boiled eggs in eight minutes, 23 meat pies in 10 minutes, 182 chicken wings in 30 minutes, and 25.5 ice cream sandwiches, also known as choc ices, in six minutes. Mr Chestnut said on social media he was ""gutted"", when he learned of the ban, adding he had ""been training to defend [his] title"".  ""To set the record straight, I do not have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with,"" he said.  MLE said it and Nathan's ""went to great lengths"" to accommodate Joey, but that it seemed he and his managers ""prioritised a new partnership"". The Fourth of July competition has taken place every year since Polish immigrant Nathan Handwerker opened his stand on Coney Island in 1916. The story goes that on 4 July 1916 - the year Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs was founded - four European immigrants were arguing about who among them was more American. They decided to settle it with a hot dog eating contest. However, the true origins of the contest  remain shrouded in mystery ."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwwz7rlgrgo,What son's conviction means for President Biden,2 days ago,Anthony Zurcher,"Hunter Biden’s conviction for lying about his drug use on a handgun licence application will be a devastating personal blow for his father, Joe Biden.  The US president doubles as the patriarch of a tight-knit family that has seen its share of personal tragedy and trauma. Now his surviving son has been found guilty of three federal crimes that carry a potentially lengthy prison term. But Hunter's verdict is unlikely to change how Americans vote in November's election. His father's name will be on the ballot, not his. There's no evidence connecting the president to his son's offences. And there has been scant polling evidence that the  public is following this trial closely. After the verdict was announced, the president released a statement hinting at the dual obligations demanding his attention. “I am the president, but I am also a dad,” he said. He added that he continued to support his son and was proud of the man he is today. At the start of the trial, Joe Biden said he wouldn’t comment on the proceedings, but his son’s courtroom drama has followed him for weeks, as he conducted his official duties and campaigned for re-election. Hunter's yet-to-be determined punishment may be similarly distracting as the president prepares later this month for a pivotal presidential debate. ""This will, of course, be a personal distraction for the president, as it would be for any father,"" says Michael LaRosa, who served as press secretary for First Lady Jill Biden during the first two years of the Biden presidency. ""It's not a distraction from his duties as president, but I'm sure it will take an emotional toll on the family."" While in France for D-Day commemorations last week, President Biden said that he would not consider using his authority to pardon his son. And he added that he would accept the jury’s verdict – a contrast from Donald Trump’s rejection of his own conviction as rigged and corrupt. The former president’s response to the Hunter Biden verdict was also markedly different. In a statement released by the campaign, Trump said the trial was “nothing more than a distraction” from what he asserted were more serious crimes committed by the Biden family. That was a sentiment echoed by many other Republicans. Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina said the verdict was just “the veil of fairness”.  Others noted that the trial only went ahead because a federal judge last year rejected what critics saw as a ""sweetheart"" plea deal. Trump’s trial became a partisan brawl from start to finish, with Republican officials lining up behind the former president to condemn the proceedings. Hunter’s conviction had a different feel, marking the culmination of a dark period for a Biden family that has known more than its share of turmoil. Hunter Biden spiralled into drug use around the time that his brother, Beau, died from brain cancer. His battles with addiction and the toll it exacted on his family relationships were presented in painful detail during the trial through excerpts from Hunter’s memoir, his text messages and emails, photographs and testimony from those close to him. All the while, friends and members of Hunter Biden’s family – including First Lady Jill Biden and his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden – sat behind him, watched and sometimes hugged him or held his hand during breaks in the trial. His half-sister Ashley cried during the defence attorney’s closing arguments. “Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support,” President Biden’s post-verdict statement concluded. “Nothing will ever change that.” The prosecuting attorney during his closing argument said the evidence presented was ugly and personal. He also said that it was overwhelming and it was necessary to show that when Hunter Biden filled out the federal background check application for a handgun, he knowingly lied when he certified that he was not using drugs. In the end, a unanimous jury agreed. This guilty verdict means the president’s son - the only surviving child from his first wife, who was killed along with his infant daughter in a car accident half a century ago – may face years in prison. Hunter Biden now awaits sentencing for his conviction, but even after the judge decides his punishment his legal travails will not be over. He is also facing a September trial on charges of failing to pay $1.4m in federal income taxes. That trial, coming less than two months before the election, may not contain the raw emotion on display in the Delaware courtroom, but it could prove more politically damaging for the president. Hunter’s foreign business dealings and his financial ties to the president have been a source of continued scrutiny by Mr Biden’s Republican critics. Drug addiction and the consequences of it have touched many American lives. Allegations of financial impropriety and tax fraud, however, may generate less sympathy from the voting public."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crggk5rvqd1o,Tesla pay fight tests power of Elon Musk's mystique ,2 days ago,Natalie Sherman,"In 2018, Tesla shareholders approved the biggest pay package in history for Elon Musk. Six years later, will they do it again? The electric car company will find out this week at its annual meeting, where it is seeking a show of support for the roughly $50bn deal. The package - worth an estimated 300 times what the top-earning boss in the US made last year - won backing from 73% of shareholders who voted six years ago. The compensation plan gives Mr Musk rights to roughly 300 million shares  – a roughly 10% stake in the firm - as a reward for the firm meeting goals once considered laughable, like becoming a $650bn firm. But earlier this year, a Delaware judge voided the deal after a small investor sued, ruling that the sum was ""unfair"" and the process for determining the package, by a board dominated by Mr Musk, was ""deeply flawed"". Instead of backing down, Tesla said it would submit the deal to another vote - and seek to reincorporate the company outside of Delaware - calling the decision ""fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders"". Tesla says the targets were ambitious and the compensation is essential to keep the billionaire engaged. ""We must stand by our deal,"" board chair Robyn Denholm wrote to shareholders this month. Presented to the world six years ago, the pay deal stirred debate, but few doubted Mr Musk's importance to Tesla's future.  This time, however, the fight is raising tough questions about his leadership, at a time when Tesla's shares have dropped sharply from their highs and its commanding lead of the electric car industry is under pressure. Mr Musk has been faulted for alienating potential buyers with controversial political musings and accused of diverting attention – and resources – to his other companies, including social media site X, formerly Twitter, which he purchased in 2022. “If this was back in 2018, I would have voted yes, but today, after everything that has happened, I voted no,” says investor Ven Kolli, an IT consultant from Colorado, who owns one of the company's cars and first purchased Tesla stock nearly a decade ago.  Though the 42-year-old expects the deal to pass, he hopes a tough vote will send a message to Tesla's board, which for years has faced concerns that it does not exert sufficient oversight of Mr Musk. He is not worried about losing Mr Musk, believing Tesla has gotten to a point where it can succeed without him. ""Since the Twitter acquisition closed, a lot of the decisions made specifically by Elon Musk have been very questionable,"" he says. ""Ultimately, while he's CEO, his responsibility is to Tesla and I think the board has lost sight of that,"" he says. ""It’s my opportunity to let my voice be heard, as small as it may be."" Legal experts say it is not clear if the court will accept the re-vote, which is not binding, and allow the company to restore the pay package. At least one shareholder has sued over the company's move already. But Tesla appears to be hoping that a resounding victory will help as its legal fight continues, says Ann Lipton, law professor at Tulane University. ""If shareholders overwhelmingly approve the pay package then Musk is hoping, and maybe he’s right, that the court will think twice about overturning it again,"" she says. With the vote nearing, Mr Musk and the company have pressed their case with a barrage of messages and television appearances, even announcing a lottery for shareholders for a Musk-led tour of its Texas factory.  Mr Musk has stoked the drama on social media, celebrating investors who have voted in favour, while reproaching opponents as “oathbreakers”. The entrepreneur, who already owns about 13% of the firm, has also raised the spectre of leaving Tesla unless he receives a bigger stake.  But keeping Mr Musk may be a less compelling argument than it once was, says Steve Westly, founder of the Westly Group, an early Tesla backer. “Elon is a unique visionary …but I don’t know if that means he’s essential to be running any or all of those companies today,” says Mr Westly, who no longer owns shares. ""No one stays on top forever, especially when you’re trying to lead seven companies at once.”  Those against the deal include the shareholder advisory companies ISS and Glass-Lewis, as well as several major government-affiliated investors, among them Norges Bank, which manages Norway's pension fund and is one of the Tesla's 10 biggest backers. Prominent Tesla investors such as Ron Baron and Cathie Wood, as well as established firms such as Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust are among those voicing support.  The trust, which owns about 3.1 million shares, says it backed the deal in 2018 because ""it introduced extremely stretching targets that would make a huge amount of money for shareholders if they were reached"".  ""Having agreed to that, we believe that it should be paid out."" Executive pay packages at major firms are typically approved with some 90% of the votes. Though the deal may not meet that threshold, analysts give it a good chance of passing, especially if Mr Musk's efforts to whip up support among his large public fan base are successful.  Retail investors, as opposed to professional firms, own more than 40% of Tesla's shares, an unusually high figure, reflecting the company's popular appeal. Some say their enthusiasm has diminished. “There’s been a lot of distractions that don’t relate to advancing the brand and making better cars and I feel like that should be the focus,” says Kheirallah Ashkar, a 28-year-old engineer in Washington DC, who first invested in the firm in 2020. “He’s done a fine job but I don’t think good enough to validate the crazy money they’re asking us to give him.” But on the eToro share trading platform, where Tesla has long been one of the most popular stocks, 97% of the votes cast have been in favour of the plan. Almost a third of the roughly 2 million shares held on the platform have voted, an unusually high number.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6pp08q513do,Biden vows to respect guilty verdict in son's gun trial,2 days ago,Bernd Debusmann Jr,"US President Joe Biden has said he will respect a jury’s decision to find his son guilty of gun crimes, after a week-long trial that laid bare a tumultuous time for the family. The 12-person jury found Hunter Biden, 54, guilty of lying about his drug use on a form while purchasing a handgun in 2018. He faces possible jail time following the verdict, which marked the first criminal prosecution of a sitting president’s child. His conviction on all three felony counts comes as President Biden campaigns for re-election in November, and less than two weeks after his election rival Donald Trump was himself convicted of a crime in New York. While President Biden did not attend the trial in Delaware, many family members including First Lady Jill Biden did so regularly. Hunter Biden’s wife, sister and uncle were all present at times to support him during proceedings. President Biden flew to Wilmington, Delaware, after the verdict where he greeted and hugged his son on the tarmac. “I am the president, but I am also a dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,” he said in a statement. Mr Biden added that he would “accept the outcome of this case and… continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal”. President Biden earlier ruled out pardoning his son, whose trial aired embarrassing details as prosecutors sought to show he was using crack cocaine at the time he bought the gun.  Jurors heard from his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and a former girlfriend, Zoe Kestan, who described frequent drug binges that took a toll on his friends and family. Text messages detailing his addiction and photographs, some showing a half-naked Hunter Biden, were also shown to the court. The verdict on Tuesday prompted instant political reaction, including from Republicans in Congress who have spent years investigating Hunter Biden’s behaviour and business ties.  James Comer, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee, said it marked a “step toward accountability”, but added that ""everyone involved"" in what he called the ""Bidens’ corrupt influence peddling schemes” should be investigated. A statement from the Trump campaign, meanwhile, said the trial had “been nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family”. The former president has often used that description of the family on the campaign trail, referring to  allegations of improper conduct  made against the president and his son by Republicans. Democrats in Congress accused their Republican colleagues of hypocrisy, and praised the US justice system.  “Compare and contrast the difference in reaction between the Republicans and the Democrats,"" Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin said in a hearing.  Referring to Trump's criminal conviction, he said: ""The Republicans are attacking our entire system of justice and the rule of law because they don’t like the way one case came out, whereas the son of the president of the United States is prosecuted and I don’t hear a single Democrat crying foul.” Meanwhile, several jurors who convicted Hunter Biden have said politics was not a factor in their decision.  ""I was never thinking of President Joe Biden,"" one juror told the BBC. ""Out of all the jurors, nobody mentioned anything about political motivations,"" he added. Aides to President Biden have told US news outlets that the trial and verdict have taken an emotional toll on Mr Biden, who has been closely watching the case. Politico reported that Mr Biden had been ""consumed with the trial for weeks"" and asked family members for updates while he was on a trip to France for D-Day anniversary events. The outlet also said Mr Biden has at times felt guilty about the spotlight that has been placed on his son, and believes his political career has contributed to his son's legal problems.  According to the Washington Post , the president's advisers have often been reluctant to speak to him about his son and some have tried to limit Hunter Biden's public appearances. Hunter Biden will be sentenced at some point in the next 120 days, but the judge overseeing the case has not set a date for the hearing. He faces up to 25 years in prison, but legal experts say it is highly unlikely the eventual sentence will be close to that given he is a first time, non-violent offender. His legal issues are set to continue throughout the year, and throughout his father's election campaign. In September, he will face trial in California on charges of failing to pay $1.4m (£1.1m) in income taxes. If convicted in that case, Hunter Biden could face up to 17 years in prison."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjqqnwnqnxko,Hunter Biden jurors say politics did not sway verdict,2 days ago,Bernd Debusmann Jr & Ana Faguy,"Jurors who convicted Hunter Biden of gun crimes on Tuesday have said they did not think about his father or politics when reaching their decision. ""I was never thinking of President Joe Biden,"" one juror told the BBC shortly after the verdict, adding that their 11 fellow jurors considered it “important” to separate the facts of the case from the family. ""Out of all the jurors, nobody mentioned anything about political motivations,” the male juror, who asked to remain anonymous, said. “Somehow, you block that out of your mind."" The verdict has prompted much political reaction, with congressional Republicans who investigated Hunter Biden for years welcoming the decision. Democrats have insisted it will not affect the president’s re-election campaign. In a brief interview, the juror told the BBC he had not considered whether it would impact November’s election. Two other jurors, meanwhile, told CNN that they did not feel any pressure during deliberations, despite the high-profile nature of the trial, during an election year. One of those jurors told CNN she anticipated the panel would be ""at each other's throats because [Biden's] father is the president and because of the political climate"", but after deliberations started, she ""didn't feel pressure"".  Jurors who spoke to other news outlets repeatedly said politics did not sway their decision, but some did have qualms about the case.  One juror told CNN the case ""seemed like a waste of taxpayer dollars"", while another juror said the process was “a little bit frustrating because it felt like we couldn’t get the full story"". Despite those frustrations, the jury was able to reach a verdict within just three hours of the week-long trial. The juror who spoke to the BBC left the case with some remorse, noting that Mr Biden is not just the US president but also a dad and ""someone just convicted [his son] in federal court"".  Biden became the first son of a sitting US president to be criminally convicted on Tuesday when the jury found him guilty of  lying about his drug use  on a federal form when purchasing a handgun in 2018.  Before the case went to trial, he pleaded not guilty to the charges, claiming he did not lie on the form because he was in recovery from drug addition at the time.  Biden was stoic during the verdict reading. He hugged family members and his legal team after  he learned his fate . He will be sentenced at some point in the next 120 days, but the judge overseeing the case did not set a date."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv225l8l7jzo,Hamas seeks 'complete halt' to war in Gaza proposal response,2 days ago,Matt Murphy,"Hamas says it has submitted its response to a US-backed plan for a ceasefire in Gaza, with a senior group official telling the BBC that it still requires an Israeli commitment to a permanent ceasefire.  In a statement, the group, and its Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) allies, expressed ""readiness to positively"" reach a deal.  The proposed ceasefire plan - which was endorsed by the UN security council on Monday night - calls for a six-week ceasefire that would eventually become permanent.  Qatar and Egypt - who, along with the US, have mediated negotiations between Israel and Hamas - confirmed that the Palestinian group had submitted its reply.  In its statement on Tuesday evening, Hamas called for a ""complete halt"" to fighting in Gaza.  ""The response prioritises the interests of our Palestinian people and emphasises the necessity of a complete halt to the ongoing aggression on Gaza,"" Hamas and the PIJ said.  The groups added that they were ready ""to engage positively to reach an agreement that ends this war"". White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said it was ""helpful"" that Hamas had submitted a response and that US officials were ""evaluating"" the group's requests.  Earlier on Tuesday US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had ""reaffirmed his commitment"" to the Gaza ceasefire plan and  the world was waiting for the Hamas response . The proposal set out by President Biden last month involves an initial six-week ceasefire, with Hamas releasing some hostages in exchange for Israel releasing an undefined number of Palestinian prisoners. A second phase would see the remaining hostages released by Hamas and a total withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as part of a “permanent” ceasefire, but the latter would still be subject to negotiations. The actual Israeli proposal - reportedly lengthier than the summary presented by Mr Biden - has not been made public and it is unclear whether it varies from what the president conveyed in his statement on 31 May. It was presented to Hamas days prior to Mr Biden's speech. Mr Netanyahu has acknowledged his war cabinet has authorised the plan but has not voiced unequivocal support for it. Far right members of his cabinet have threatened to quit his coalition and trigger its collapse if the deal goes forward, seeing it as surrender to Hamas. As Mr Blinken met Israeli officials in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, protesters outside his hotel held American flags calling for an agreement. Many held pictures of hostages and chanted: ""SOS, USA"", and ""we trust you, Blinken, seal a deal"". Vicki Cohen, the mother of Nimrod Cohen, 19, an Israeli soldier who was kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October, held a banner showing his picture. She told the BBC: ""We come here to ask Blinken and the USA government to help us, to save us from our government. Our prime minister doesn't want to bring our loved ones back, we need their help to pressure our government."" He then travelled to the Dead Sea for a conference of Arab leaders calling for greater aid access into Gaza, where he said Israel ""can do more"". He also announced $404 million in new aid for Palestinians, urging other countries to also ""step up"" assistance. The war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 37,000 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive since then."
